# Batteries
## Functions
### resource adequacy
  
### peak capacity
  
### black-start or local weak-grid issues
  
### frequency control and ancillary services (FCAS)

### congestion relief

### circuit trips (avoid)
To survive the loss of one line or a big generator, system operators must leave “headroom” on the interconnector, so it might cap imports at (say) X MW to avoid thermal overload if a circuit trips. Grid must be N-1 secure.
