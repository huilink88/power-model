# Frequency Control

# What is Frequency Control
**Frequency control** services deal with keeping system frequency at (or near) its nominal value (50 Hz or 60 Hz), by balancing **active power** supply and demand in real time.

They include things like:
1) Primary / fast frequency response (FCR, FFR)
2) Secondary control / automatic generation control (AGC)
3) Tertiary reserves / manual frequency restoration

These services:
* Are activated based on frequency deviation (e.g., 49.8 Hz → trigger response).
* Are paid to provide capacity and/or energy to counter sudden imbalance.

So: frequency control = **keeping the whole system’s frequency stable**.
